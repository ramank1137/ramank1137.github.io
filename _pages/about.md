After gaining over five years of experience in the industry, I decided to transition to academia, driven by a desire to work at the intersection of technology and social impact. To pursue this, I joined `Graphics and Vision Lab, IIT Delhi` where I contributed to democratizing access to the training of an essential neurosurgical skill: Microscopic Neuro Drilling, for Indiaâ€™s underserved populations.  Collaborating with [Prof. Prem Kalra](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~pkalra/) and [Dr. Ashish Suri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashish_Suri) our efforts led to the development of an application currently training future neurosurgeons at the [NETS Lab](https://www.aiimsnets.org/), AIIMS. Additionally, our project, as part of Neuromentor, earned the prestigious [Prix Galien India award](https://www.iifaindia.org/award_modi_prix.html) and a resulting journal paper is currently under review.

Continuing my pursuit of impactful challenges, I joined `ICTD Lab, IIT Delhi`. Here, as a Research Associate under [Prof. Aaditeshwar Seth](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~aseth/) I am applying machine learning techniques to `geospatial datasets` to address critical societal and environmental issues. Here, I am working on improving `Land Use Land Cover` classification over India's diverse landscapes addressing challenges such as limited dataset availability. Specifically, I am developing computer vision models for high resolution (1.19m pixel resolution) images to delineate and distinguish scrublands and farmlands. I am also working on an unsupervised learning approach to compute (at 10m pixel resolution) `cropping intensity` using time series of vegetation indexes obtained from Landsat, Sentinel and Modis. Additionally, I am working on building India's first `forest fire forecasting` model which can forecast both natural and anthropogenic fires based on climate and human varaibles.
